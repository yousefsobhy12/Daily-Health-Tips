## Key Components

### FCM Service (`lib/services/fcm_service.dart`)

- Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging setup
- Manages notification permissions
- Handles foreground and background messages
- Topic subscription for personalized notifications

### Health Tips Service (`lib/services/health_tips_service.dart`)

- Contains sample health tips data
- Filters tips based on user age and goals
- Provides personalized recommendations

### User Profile Service (`lib/services/user_profile_service.dart`)

- Manages user profile data
- Handles local storage with SharedPreferences
- Manages notification preferences

## Sending Personalized Notifications

To send personalized notifications to users, you can use Firebase Cloud Messaging with topics:

### Topic-Based Notifications

Users are automatically subscribed to topics based on their profile:

- `user_{userId}` - User-specific notifications
- `goal_{goalName}` - Goal-based notifications (e.g., `goal_lose_weight`)
- `age_{ageGroup}` - Age group notifications (e.g., `age_26_35`)

### Example FCM Message

```json
{
  "to": "/topics/goal_lose_weight",
  "notification": {
    "title": "Daily Health Tip",
    "body": "Stay hydrated! Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily to boost metabolism."
  },
  "data": {
    "tipId": "1",
    "category": "nutrition"
  }
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Health Tips

1. Edit `lib/services/health_tips_service.dart`
2. Add new `HealthTip` objects to the `_healthTips` list
3. Specify target goals and age groups

### Modifying Notification Schedule

1. Users can set their preferred time in the app
2. For server-side scheduling, implement a Cloud Function
3. Use the user's `notificationTime` preference

### Styling

The app uses Material Design 3 with a green theme. You can customize colors in `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  primarySwatch: Colors.green,
  useMaterial3: true,
  // ... other theme settings
),
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase not initialized:**

   - Ensure `firebase_options.dart` has correct configuration
   - Check that `google-services.json` is in the right location

2. **Notifications not working:**

   - Verify notification permissions are granted
   - Check FCM token is generated correctly
   - Ensure device is connected to internet

3. **Build errors:**
   - Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
   - Check all dependencies are compatible

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking the console output for:

- FCM token generation
- Topic subscription status
- Notification delivery
